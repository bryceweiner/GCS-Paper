The Impact of Quantum Branching on Quantum Entanglement

## Abstract

This analysis examines the nature of quantum entanglement within the framework of the Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) model, where reality is proposed to continuously manifest through a process of quantum branching at a rate of γ ≈ 1.89 × 10⁻²⁹ s⁻¹. We demonstrate how entanglement arises as a consequence of the coherent branching of quantum systems and discuss the implications of the holographic principle on the limits of entanglement across branch boundaries.

## Quantum Entanglement in the QBU Model

### 1. Branching and Coherent Quantum States

In the QBU model, the state of a quantum system is described by a wavefunction that evolves through a continuous process of quantum branching (Zurek, 2003; DOI: 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.715). When two or more quantum systems interact, their wavefunctions become entangled, resulting in a unified quantum state that cannot be factored into independent subsystems.

### 2. Persistence of Entanglement Across Branching

The key feature of entanglement in the QBU framework is that it persists across the branching events that define the continuous manifestation of reality (Kiefer & Polarski, 2009; DOI: 10.1142/S0217732309031521). As the quantum systems branch, their entangled state is maintained, creating a shared information channel between the resulting branches.

### 3. Holographic Principle and Entanglement Constraints

However, the holographic principle ('t Hooft, 1993; DOI: 10.1007/BF02435629) imposes a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored or exchanged within a given spatial region. This constraint suggests that direct entanglement and information transfer between distinct branches of the QBU model may not be possible, as the information content of each branch is bounded by its own holographic horizon.

### 4. Entanglement Within Branches

While entanglement cannot directly cross the boundaries between branches, it can persist within individual branches of the QBU model. This allows for the coherent manipulation and transfer of quantum states through standard teleportation and other quantum information protocols, as long as they are confined to a single branch of reality.

### 5. Observational Implications

Experimental observations of quantum entanglement, particularly those demonstrating the persistence of entanglement over time and distance, can be interpreted as evidence supporting the QBU model's description of reality as a continuous branching process. However, any attempts to extend entanglement across branch boundaries would be expected to fail due to the holographic information constraint.

## Conclusion

In the Quantum Branching Universe model, quantum entanglement arises as a consequence of the coherent branching of quantum systems. While entanglement can be maintained within individual branches, the holographic principle limits the ability to directly entangle or transfer information between distinct branches of reality. This framework provides a novel interpretation of the nature and limitations of quantum entanglement in the context of the QBU's dynamic model of the universe.
