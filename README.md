# Welcome to the Quantum Branching Universe

This repository is home to a collection of works regarding the theory of the Quantum Branching Universe, or QBU.

The two files to begin with would be Paper.md, which formulates the basis of the QBU theory, and QBU.md which goes into greater detail as to the nature and construction of the QBU model.

appendix-a.md contains mathematical models for many equations to include Î³ (Weiner's constant of Universal Quantum Branching) in standard calculations.

Comments are welcome.
