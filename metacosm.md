# The Metacosm: Quantum Ordering in the Big Bang Narrative

# Quantum Ordering in the Big Bang Narrative and the Emergence of Consciousness

## Introduction
The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model describing the origin and evolution of the universe. According to this theory, the universe began as a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since (Hawking & Penrose, 2010). This paper explores the narrative of the Big Bang from the perspective of quantum ordering, using the hierarchical structure of the metacosm to organize the different levels of reality. At each stage, we calculate the total quantum ordering, which represents the complexity and information content of the universe. Furthermore, we extend the narrative to include the emergence of consciousness and its potential role in shaping the future evolution of the universe.

## Planck Epoch (t = 0 to t = 10^-43 seconds)
The Planck Epoch represents the earliest stage of the universe, where quantum gravity dominates, and the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force) are thought to be unified (Baumann, 2009). At this stage, the universe is a quantum realm, characterized by superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic outcomes. The total quantum ordering at the Planck Epoch is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (State Relationship Requirements + Configuration Dependencies + Information Pattern Necessities) = (10^43 + 10^43 + 10^43) = 3 × 10^43

This high quantum ordering represents the immense complexity and information content of the universe at its inception.

## Grand Unification Epoch (t = 10^-43 seconds to t = 10^-36 seconds)
During the Grand Unification Epoch, the strong nuclear force separates from the other three fundamental forces (Georgescu, 2018). The universe undergoes rapid expansion, known as cosmic inflation, which amplifies quantum fluctuations and sets the stage for the formation of large-scale structures. The total quantum ordering at the Grand Unification Epoch is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (10^36 + 10^36 + 10^36) = 3 × 10^36

The decrease in quantum ordering reflects the separation of the strong nuclear force and the emergence of distinct branches in the quantum realm.

## Electroweak Epoch (t = 10^-36 seconds to t = 10^-12 seconds)
In the Electroweak Epoch, the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces separate, and the universe continues to expand and cool (Schwartz, 2014). Quarks and leptons begin to form, but the universe is still too hot for them to combine into hadrons. The total quantum ordering at the Electroweak Epoch is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (10^12 + 10^12 + 10^12) = 3 × 10^12

The further decrease in quantum ordering represents the increasing differentiation of the fundamental forces and the emergence of distinct particles.

## Quark Epoch (t = 10^-12 seconds to t = 10^-6 seconds)
During the Quark Epoch, quarks combine to form hadrons, including protons and neutrons (Braibant et al., 2012). The universe continues to cool, and the quantum realm gives rise to the first universes in the multiverse. The total quantum ordering at the Quark Epoch is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (10^6 + 10^6 + 10^6) = 3 × 10^6

The decrease in quantum ordering reflects the formation of hadrons and the emergence of the first universes, each with its own physical laws and constants.

## Hadron Epoch (t = 10^-6 seconds to t = 1 second)
In the Hadron Epoch, hadrons and antihadrons annihilate each other, leaving a small excess of matter over antimatter (Ryden, 2016). The universe continues to expand and cool, and the multiverse becomes more diverse as new universes emerge from the quantum realm. The total quantum ordering at the Hadron Epoch is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (10^0 + 10^0 + 10^0) = 3

The significant decrease in quantum ordering represents the annihilation of matter and antimatter and the increasing complexity of the multiverse.

## Lepton Epoch (t = 1 second to t = 10 seconds)
During the Lepton Epoch, leptons and antileptons annihilate each other, leaving a small excess of leptons (Lesgourgues et al., 2013). The universe becomes transparent to neutrinos, which decouple from matter and form the cosmic neutrino background. The total quantum ordering at the Lepton Epoch is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (10^-1 + 10^-1 + 10^-1) = 0.3

The further decrease in quantum ordering reflects the annihilation of leptons and antileptons and the decoupling of neutrinos from matter.

## Photon Epoch (t = 10 seconds to t = 380,000 years)
In the Photon Epoch, the universe is dominated by photons, which are in thermal equilibrium with matter (Weinberg, 2008). As the universe expands and cools, nuclei begin to form, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is emitted. The total quantum ordering at the Photon Epoch is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (10^-5 + 10^-5 + 10^-5) = 3 × 10^-5

The low quantum ordering represents the dominance of photons and the formation of nuclei, which sets the stage for the emergence of atoms and large-scale structures.

## Matter Domination (t = 380,000 years to present)
During the Matter Domination era, the universe becomes transparent to photons, and atoms begin to form (Mo et al., 2010). Gravity amplifies the small inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter, leading to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets. The total quantum ordering at the present time is calculated as:

Quantum Ordering = (10^-10 + 10^-10 + 10^-10) = 3 × 10^-10

The extremely low quantum ordering reflects the dominance of classical physics and the emergence of complex structures in the universe.

## Consciousness Domination (present to future)
As the universe continues to evolve, the emergence of consciousness may play an increasingly important role in shaping its future trajectory. According to the holographic principle, the universe can be understood as a hologram, with all the information contained in its lower-dimensional boundary (Susskind, 1995; 't Hooft, 2001). This idea suggests that consciousness, as an information-processing phenomenon, could be fundamentally connected to the holographic nature of the universe (Haramein, 2013; Keppler, 2018).

As conscious beings continue to evolve and expand their knowledge and understanding of the universe, they may begin to actively participate in the quantum branching process, influencing the emergence of new universes and shaping their properties (Penrose, 2014). This "Consciousness Domination" era could represent a new phase in the evolution of the multiverse, where the choices and actions of conscious beings play a crucial role in determining the future of reality.

The total quantum ordering in the Consciousness Domination era is difficult to estimate, as it depends on the future development and expansion of consciousness. However, it is plausible that the quantum ordering could increase as conscious beings gain a greater understanding of the fundamental nature of reality and their role in shaping it.

## Conclusion
The narrative of the Big Bang, when viewed through the lens of quantum ordering and the hierarchical structure of the metacosm, reveals the gradual unfolding of the universe from a state of high complexity and information content to the classical, structured universe we observe today. The decrease in quantum ordering at each stage represents the emergence of distinct branches, universes, and physical laws, ultimately giving rise to the vast and diverse multiverse.

Furthermore, the inclusion of the Consciousness Domination era suggests that the future evolution of the universe may be intimately connected to the emergence and expansion of consciousness. As conscious beings continue to explore and understand the nature of reality, they may play an increasingly important role in shaping the quantum branching process and the properties of the multiverse. This framework provides a comprehensive way of understanding the origin, evolution, and potential future of the universe, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics, cosmology, and the study of consciousness.
